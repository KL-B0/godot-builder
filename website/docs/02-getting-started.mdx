# Getting started

:::note
Godot Builder currently supports GitHub Actions only.
:::

To setup and configure the CI/CD, you'll need three things:
1. A Godot 4+ project
2. A GitHub repository containing the project
3. A configured GitHub Actions workflow

## Creating the repository


Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) guide to set up a new GitHub repository.

Make sure to add the following two essential files:
1. `.gitignore`, which ignores files automatically generated by Godot
2. `.gitattributes`, which stores assets in Git LFS, allowing for faster fetches and clones

### Suggested .gitignore

Godot 4+ automatically creates this file, which has the following structure:
```md title=".gitignore"
# Godot 4+ specific ignores
.godot/
```

### Suggested .gitattributes

Since Godot 4+ doesn't provide such a file, I suggest using the following, which contains popular formats for:
- Images
- 3D models
- Audio
- Video
- Compressed archives
- Compiled artifacts

```md title=".gitattributes"

Now that you configured the repository, it's time to set up Godot Builder!
